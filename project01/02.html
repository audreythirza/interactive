<br>
	the hard season
	will
	split you wild.
	do not worry.
</br>

<br>
	you will bleed water.
	do not worry.
	this is grief.
</br>

<br>
	your smile will fall out and down your skin
	and
	there will be some scorching.
	but do not worry.
</br>

<br>
	keep speaking the years from their hiding places.
	keep coughing up smoke from all the deaths you have died.
	keep the rage tender.
	because the soft season will come

<br>
	it will come
	loud
	ready
	gulping
	both hands in your heart
	up all night
	up all of the nights
	to drink all damage into love.
</br>
