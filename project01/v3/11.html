	the hard season
	will
	split you wild.
	do not worry.
	you will bleed water.
	do not worry.
	this is grief.

<div class="p2">
	<p>
	your smile will fall out and down your skin
	and
	there will be some scorching.
	but do not worry.
	keep speaking the years from their hiding places.
	keep coughing up smoke from all the deaths you have died.
	keep the rage tender.
	because the soft season will come

<div class="p3">
	<p>
	it will come
	loud
	ready
	gulping
	both hands in your heart
	up all night
	up all of the nights
	to drink all damage into love.
