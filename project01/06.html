	the hard season
	will
	split you wild.
	do not worry.

	your smile will fall out and down your skin 
	and
	there will be some scorching.
	but do not worry.

<h4>
	<p>keep speaking the years from their hiding places.</p>
	<p>keep coughing up smoke from all the deaths you have died.</p>
	<p>keep the rage tender.</p>
	<p>because the soft season will come</p>

<h3>
	<p>it will come</p>
	<p>loud</p>

	<p>up all night</p>
	<p>up all of the nights</p>
	<p>to drink all damage into love.</p>
