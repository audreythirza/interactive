		<strong>
			<p>your smile will fall out and down your skin and
			there will be some scorching.
			but do not worry.
			keep speaking the years from their hiding places.
			keep coughing up smoke from all the deaths you have died.
			keep the rage tender.
			because the soft season will come
			it will come</p>
