	<p>For thousands of years, human beings have created the spiral paths that fold back on themselves within labyrinths for reasons ranging from decoration to art and myth. As well, the labyrinth has long been used as a creative or spiritual tool. If you have a problem, you can use the labyrinth to help solve it. If you have a need to discover spiritual meaning or find inspiration, a labyrinth can be put to service for you.</p>

	<p>
	As a meditation tool consisting of a walkable single line path, a labyrinth can be a source of solace and can quiet a distracted or overactive mind. When troubled by disturbing emotions or unfortunate events in your life, walking a labyrinth can help resolve your inner discomfort and still your mind enough for you to get clarity of what is going on. As a spiritual tool, both the calming and quieting effect and the metaphorical symbolism of the labyrinth as a pathway on a journey or a spiritual track can help you to ponder life's greater mysteries.</p>
